			"Most IQ tests are not suitable for children, as they are originally developed for the adult population. However, if you want to know the IQ of a child between the ages of 7 and 16, there are several tests that can help you. There is an IQ test for children, developed by us, which, unlike similar ones, can also determine the IQ level of children at the age of 6 years.The child will be shown a series of three pictures arranged with some regularity. Children will need to choose pictures that are suitable for an empty cell. The first four questions should be answered together with the child so that he/she understands the essence of the task - these questions are not taken into account in the calculation of the childâ€™s IQ. Let's get started!",

			"Procrastination is a very common phenomenon in the modern world. Proof of this is the large amount of research on this topic and heated discussions on procrastination and how to deal with it on social networks and in forums among non-specialists.

			"The modern world is completely built on the observance of the roles that society ascribes to a person. Gender roles are particularly important. Understanding them has been developed by people for thousands of years, clear rules have been created for their observance, which is why they are, perhaps, the most stringent. Many men and women suffer from the fact that they are required to comply with this role, which is largely stereotypical and, often, does not correspond to the realities of the modern world. The gender role is the inner essence of a person, which manifests itself in his worldview and behavior. It is noteworthy that scientists have proved that the connection of gender identity with a person's sex is not at all necessary. A man can think and feel like a woman, while a woman can lead such a way of communication, self-expression, which is more inherent in men. Answering these questions of the gender role test to determine your gender identity, you need to choose the option that most accurately describes you, your behavior, your outlook on life.",

It is a person\'s consciousness of his interaction with the objective world and the subjective world (psyche), his vital needs, thoughts, feelings, motives, instincts, experiences, and actions. In psychology, self-awareness is a mental phenomenon, a person\'s consciousness of himself as a subject of activity, as a result of which a person\'s ideas about self are formed into a mental image of self. This test is from IPIP (International Personality Item Pool) and it can help you define self conscious. This test defines two scales: "Private Self-Consciousness" and "Public Self-Consciousness".',
